## Wath is Cloud Gaming
Cloud gaming, also known as game streaming or game-as-a-service, is a technology that allows users to play video games via the internet without the need for dedicated gaming hardware. Instead of running games on a local device, cloud gaming services host games on powerful remote servers in data centers. Players interact with the game through a client application, and the video and audio outputs are streamed to their devices while their input commands are sent back to the server. This allows gamers to enjoy high-quality gaming experiences on a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and smart TVs.

## How it Works

Cloud gaming involves several key components and technologies:

- **Cloud Servers**: High-performance servers in data centers run the games and handle the processing of game data.
- **Client Applications**: Users install client applications on thier devices (e.g., smartphones, PCs, or consoles) to connect to the platform.
- **Streaming: The game**`s video and audio outputs are encoded and streamd to the client device, allowing players to see and hear the game in real-time.
- **Input Handling**: Player input commands (e.g., keyboard, mouse, or controller inputs) are sent from the client device to the cloud server.
- **Latency Reduction**: Advanced technologies and algorithms are employed to minimize input lag and reduce latency, ensuring a responsive gaming experience.
- **Session Managment**: The platform manages gaming sessions, including session sharing and real-time monitoring.
- **Game Library**: Cloud gaming platforms offer a library of games that users can access and play on-demand, often via subscription models.
