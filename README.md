<sup>As a developer working on a cloud gaming platform, my role involves designing and building the backend infrastructure and systems that power the platform, as well as developing the client-side applications and user interfaces that players use to access and play games. This includes working with cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud, integrating game engines and other third-party software, and implementing features such as multiplayer functionality, game saves, and social features.
Cloud gaming has the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry by providing accessible and high-quality gaming experiences to a wider audience.
